  <description>
    The plane will be in "approach" state with engines running.
    Initial Airspeed is set to 80 knots.
    You should also set an --altitude=... setting to start in-air
    and an offset position to a runway to practice approaches or use the launcher to set this up.

    Start this state with --state=approach.
